ocr_kata_ruby
=============
This is an implementation of the Bank OCR Kata, in Ruby.

(See http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataBankOCR)

Included is accounts.txt, a sample input file with entries containing all
digits, and covering valid, invalid, and illegible account numbers.

This implementation satisfies user stories 1, 2, and 3.

ADDENDUM:  Commit cc896dbb56 was working version when kata was sent to
Nat Bennink.  Decided to see if I could improve it a bit;  Commit 57507e671e
is most recent refactored version.
